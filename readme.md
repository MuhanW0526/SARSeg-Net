## Description
Training by LIDAR point cloud for SAR 3D reconstruction point cloud segmentation based on the proposed UDA framework
## Dataset
- Trainning Set on Source Domain：
  
    The LiDAR point cloud data used for training is the Vaihingen3D dataset released at ISPRS, which can be downloaded from the official website:
  
    https://www.isprs.org/education/benchmarks/UrbanSemLab/3d-semantic-labeling.aspx
  
- SAR Dataset on Target Domain

    The SAR 3D point cloud used to implement SAR 3D point cloud segmentation on the target domain is obtained from an elevation-directed inverse reconstruction based on a sequence of SAR 2D images from the SARMV3D dataset.

    - SARMV3D Dataset：
